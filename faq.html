                What is the difference between “Ecosystem Support Program” and
                “Ethereum Grants Program”?
              </h4>
              <p>
                The Ecosystem Support Program is an expansion of the original
                Ethereum Grants Program which mainly focused on financial
                support. The Ecosystem Support Program was created to leverage
                Ethereum Foundation resources to increase the Ethereum
                ecosystem’s capacity to self-sustain and thrive. Awarding grants
                continues to be an important tool for us; but impact often takes
                more than just money, so we’ve expanded the range of support we
                provide. Our goal is to take an individual approach to each
                project, working together with the grantee to establish
                realistic goals and offering support targeted to facilitate
                those goals.

              <p>
                To give you an idea of what the Ecosystem Support Program can do
                for you, here is a non-exhaustive list some of the ways we have
                helped other applicants.
              </p>
              <p>We have:</p>

                  Facilitated project participation in events (hackathons,

                  get feedback
                </li>
                <li>Provided introduction to other funding programs</li>
              </ul>

                We are still expanding the scope of our support, so if what
                you’re looking for is not on this list, please get in touch and
                let us know what you need!

              <h4>Who can apply?</h4>
              <p>
                <strong>What types of projects are we interested in?</strong>
                Some previous areas of focus have been 2.0 clients, state
                channels, scaling/layer 2, zero knowledge proofs and more - but
                we’re always open to new ideas. If you think your project will
                make Ethereum better for everyone, we want to hear about it!
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Are you open to enterprise?</strong> Of course! We are
                happy to work with for-profit entities that are contributing to
                the Ethereum ecosystem, although enterprise projects are likely
                to be better suited to receive non-financial support such as
                mentorship, introductions to domain experts, or facilitated
                collaborations.

              <p>
                You’ll be assigned a guide, who will be a consistent point of
                contact to help you navigate the process. There will be an
                initial conversation and peer review to determine whether the
                program is a good fit for your project and what types of support
                might be most appropriate. If it seems like a fit, you’ll enter
                the next phase of formally applying for a grant, exploring other
                resources, or both. Whichever track(s) you embark on, your guide
                will be with you every step of the way.

                You should hear from us within about two weeks after you get in
                touch. If your inquiry progresses to a grant application, the
                overall process may take a few weeks to a few months depending
                on the scope and complexity of your project.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Is my application confidential?</strong> Any information
                you provide may be shared in the peer-review process, so be
                mindful of what you decide to include.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Can grants be paid out in ETH?</strong>
                We can provide payment in ETH or Fiat currency.
